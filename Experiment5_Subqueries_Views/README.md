# Experiment 5: Subqueries and Views

## AIM
To study and implement subqueries and views.

## THEORY

### Subqueries
A subquery is a query inside another SQL query and is embedded in:
- WHERE clause
- HAVING clause
- FROM clause

**Types:**
- **Single-row subquery**:
  Sub queries can also return more than one value. Such results should be made use along with the operators in and any.
- **Multiple-row subquery**:
  Here more than one subquery is used. These multiple sub queries are combined by means of ‘and’ & ‘or’ keywords.
- **Correlated subquery**:
  A subquery is evaluated once for the entire parent statement whereas a correlated Sub query is evaluated once per row processed by the parent statement.

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```
### Views
A view is a virtual table based on the result of an SQL SELECT query.
**Create View:**
```sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Drop View:**
```sql
DROP VIEW view_name;
```

**Question 1**
--
From the following tables write a SQL query to find the order values greater than the average order value of 10th October 2012. Return ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id.

Note: date should be yyyy-mm-dd format

ORDERS TABLE

name            type

ord_no          int
purch_amt    real
ord_date       text
customer_id  int
salesman_id  int

```sql
SELECT ord_no, purch_amt, ord_date, customer_id, salesman_id
FROM orders
WHERE purch_amt > (
    SELECT AVG(purch_amt)
    FROM orders
    WHERE ord_date = '2012-10-10'
);

```

**Output:**
